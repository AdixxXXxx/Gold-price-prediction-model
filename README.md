# 🪙 Gold Price Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict gold prices based on historical and economic indicators. It demonstrates the application of regression models for real-world financial forecasting.

## 📌 Project Description

Gold is a vital asset in global markets, and accurately predicting its price can be valuable for investors, economists, and analysts. This notebook explores a predictive approach using supervised machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using regression algorithms (like Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter/Google Colab
